## Analysing fitness tracker data

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.


## Load in libraries

```{r}
library(knitr)
library(dplyr)
library(tibble)

```
## 1. Code for reading in the dataset and/or processing the data

```{r}

if(!file.exists("./activity.csv")){
  
download.file(url="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip",
              destfile = "./cp.zip",method = "curl" )
 unzip(zipfile = "./cp.zip")
 file.remove("cp.zip")
}

d <- read.csv(file = "activity.csv")
head(d)
```


## 2. Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

```{r}

total_steps <- as_tibble(d) %>% group_by(date) %>% dplyr::summarise(total_steps = sum(steps, na.rm=T)) 

hist(total_steps$total_steps, breaks = 100, main="Histogram of the total number of steps\n taken each day", xlab="Total steps a day", ylab="Frequency/Days")
```

## 3. Mean and median number of steps taken each day
```{r}
mean_steps <- mean(total_steps$total_steps)
print(paste0("The mean of the total number of steps taken per day is ", round(mean_steps,digits = 2) ))
median_steps <- median(total_steps$total_steps)
print(paste0("The median of the total number of steps taken per day is ", median_steps ))
```
## 4. Time series plot of the average number of steps taken

```{r}

ave_steps_interval <- d %>% group_by(interval) %>% summarise(iv_mean = mean(steps, na.rm = T))
plot(ave_steps_interval$interval, ave_steps_interval$iv_mean, t="l", main="Time series plot",
     xlab="5 min intervals", ylab="Average number of steps taken")
```

## 5. The 5-minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum number of steps
```{r}
max_iv = ave_steps_interval[ave_steps_interval$iv_mean == max(ave_steps_interval$iv_mean),] 
print( paste0( "The 5-minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum number of steps (",round(max_iv$iv_mean, digits = 2) ,") : ", as.character(max_iv$interval)))

```

## 6. Code to describe and show a strategy for imputing missing data

>6.1 Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)

```{r}
 sum(is.na(d$steps))

```
>6.2 Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.

>> We will choose to fill up the missing data with the mean for the given 5 min interval

>6.3 Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in

```{r}

imputed_steps <- ave_steps_interval$iv_mean[match(d$interval, ave_steps_interval$interval)]

d_imp <- transform(d,  steps = ifelse(is.na(d$steps), yes = imputed_steps, no = d$steps))

```
>6.4 (7) Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?


```{r}
imp_total_daily <- d_imp %>% group_by(date) %>% summarise(total_steps = sum(steps))


hist(imp_daily$total_steps, breaks = 100, main="Histogram of the total number of steps\n taken each day", xlab="Total steps a day", ylab="Frequency/Days")

# mean of steps taken a day
mean(imp_total_daily$total_steps)

# median of steps taken a day
median(imp_total_daily$total_steps)

```

## 8. Panel plot comparing the average number of steps taken per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekends

```{r}
library(lubridate)
Sys.setlocale("LC_ALL", "en_US")

# Function that categorizes the day names into weekday/weekend

daytype <- function(day){
  if(day %in% c("Sunday", "Saturday")){
    return("weekend")
  }else{
    return("weekday")
  }
}

# categorization of days
d$day <- as.character(lapply(X = weekdays(as.Date(d$date,format="%Y-%m-%d")),daytype))

# average step intervals by weekday/weekend category
weekday_ave_steps_interval <- d[d$day == "weekday",] %>% group_by(interval) %>% summarise(iv_mean = mean(steps, na.rm = T))

weekend_ave_steps_interval <- d[d$day == "weekend",] %>% group_by(interval) %>% summarise(iv_mean = mean(steps, na.rm = T))

# creating the plot

mean_daytype_steps <-  aggregate(steps ~ interval + day, d, mean, na.rm = TRUE)

library(ggplot2)
Plot <-  ggplot(mean_daytype_steps, aes(x = interval , y = steps, color = dayType)) + 
  geom_line() + ggtitle("Average Daily Steps by Day Type") + 
  xlab("Interval") + 
  ylab("Average Number of Steps") +
  facet_wrap(~dayType, ncol = 1, nrow=2) +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Day Type") +
  theme_calc(base_family = "serif")

print(dayPlot) 


```


```{r}
```


```{r}
```
